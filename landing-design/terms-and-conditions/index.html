                            endeavours to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information
                            we collect from users on our website, located at moodapp (the “Site”), and
                            the services offered through the Site. If you have any questions about our
                            Privacy Policy, our collection practices, the processing of user information, or

                        <h3>What Data We Collect</h3>
                        <p>General Data: The use of our services will automatically create information that
                            will be collected. For example, when you use our Services, your geographic
                            location, how you use the Services, information about the type of device you
                            use, your Open Device Identification Number, date/time stamps for your visit,
                            your unique device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet
                            Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is
                            generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and
                            administer and improve the Site.</p>
                        <p>Log Files: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
                            automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses,
                            browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating
                            system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to
                            maintain and improve the performance of the Services.</p>
                        <p>Analytics: We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google
                            Analytics) to help analyze how users use the Site. Analytics services use
                            Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use
                            the information to improve our Site and Services. The analytics services'
                            ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their
                            terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information
                            about how these entities use this information.</p>
                        <p>Location Information: If you have enabled location services on your mobile
                            device, we may collect your location information to improve the Services we
                            offer. If you do not want this information collected, you can disable location
                            services on your device.</p>
                        <p>Cookies: “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that a website
                            sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. These
                            text files can be used by websites to make the users experience more efficient.
                            The law states that we can store these cookies on your device if they are
                            strictly necessary for the operation of this site. For all other types of
                            cookies we need your permission. To that end, this site uses different types of
                            cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party services that appear on our
                            pages. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies (which expire once
                            you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer
                            until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
                            experience on our Services and to market the Services or other products.
                            Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The intention is
                            to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and
                            thereby more valuable for publishers and third party advertisers. This tracking
                            is done on an anonymous basis and, while not an exhaustive list, some of the
                            companies we work with are Google, AppNexus, Criteo, Rubicon, Pubmatic and
                            DistrictM. To learn more about this practice, including the Self Regulatory
                            Principles for Online Advertising, to which we adhere, you can visit

                        <h3>Use of Your Personal information</h3>
                        <p>In general, personal information you submit to us is used either to respond to
                            requests that you make, aid us in serving you better, or market our Services. We
                            use your personal information in the following ways:</p>

                            <li>Respond to comments and questions and provide customer service;</li>
                            <li>Link or combine user information with other personal information we get from
                                third parties, to help understand your needs and provide you with better
                                service;</li>

                            Services and improve Site functionality. We reserve the right to use anonymous
                            data for any purpose and disclose anonymous data to third parties at our sole
                            discretion.</p>
                        <p>We may receive testimonials and comments from users who have had positive
                            experiences with our Services. We may publish such content. When we publish this
